BULSU MMS is a simple and functional Membership Management System developed as the Final Requirement for the course WST 2 – Web Systems and Technologies 2. This project allows users to manage student and organization members by performing basic CRUD operations—adding, viewing, editing, and deleting member records.

The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML to provide a user-friendly interface for handling member data, with features such as searchable tables, responsive design, and data validation.
